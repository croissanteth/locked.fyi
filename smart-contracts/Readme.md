## Locked.fyi smart-contracts

Locked.fyi has a deployed lock-contract on the ethereum mainnet, which is used by default when authors don't deploy their own lock. This lock has a hook registered, which is called each time a key is purchased. The source for the hook is found in `./contracts/BondingCurveHook.sol`.

### Running Tests

Run `npm install` in the smart-contracts directory to install dependencies.
The project is using Buidler & ethers.js (instead of the more common Trufle & web3.js). For their respective documentations, see:

- Buidler: https://buidler.dev/getting-started/
- ethers.js: https://docs.ethers.io/v5/getting-started/

To run the tests in the '/test`directory, just run`npm test`. The project uses a local installation of Buidler so you don't need to install it globally. Run`npx buidler help` for more options.

### Bonding Curve

The curve function used is P=log2(S) / 3.321928094887362, which aproximates a base-10 logarithm very closely.
As solidity has no native support for fixed-point numbers, a library from ABDK Consulting is utilized to enable the required math functionality:
https://github.com/abdk-consulting/abdk-libraries-solidity/blob/939f0a264f2d07a9e2c7a3a020f0db2c0885dc01/ABDKMath64x64.sol#L8

An excerpt from the linked library:

> Smart contract library of mathematical functions operating with signed 64.64-bit fixed point numbers. Signed 64.64-bit fixed point number is basically a simple fraction whose numerator is signed 128-bit integer and denominator is 2^64. As long as denominator is always the same, there is no need to store it, thus in Solidity signed 64.64-bit fixed point numbers are represented by int128 type holding only the numerator.

The constant value `DENOMINATOR` is simply 2^64, and the constant `CURVE_MODIFER` is the fixed-point representation of the value 3.321928094887362 from our curve function. (3.321928094887362 \* 2^64)

## System setup

The steps to perform a new system setup are descibed in LOCKED.FYI/smart-contracts/system-setup.md.
The system is currently deployed only on the Rinkeby test network. The documented procedure was used to setup and configure the network. This is also the guide to deploying on any other networks.
